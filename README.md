# sbad-engine
.NET Standard libraries to provide basic gameplay and user interface elements in MonoGame / XNA

## Libraries
- [Core](SBad.Engine/SBad.Core) - Commonly used classes and interfaces
- [Engine](SBad.Engine/SBad.Engine) - Classes for managing game state and basic user input
- [Visual](SBad.Engine/SBad.Visual): Helper classes and extensions for handling the drawing of visuals and animation
- [Visual.UI](SBad.Engine/SBad.Visual.UI): Layout and interactivity for user interface elements (windows, buttons, etc.) 

## Why "sbad"? Is this bad?
The name of my game is "Super Baddy" so the namespace once seemed like a good idea.
